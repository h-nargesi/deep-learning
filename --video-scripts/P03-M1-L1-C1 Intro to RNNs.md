# Intro to RNNs

One of the coolest deep learning result in last year was the google translator update. ... either machine learning for while, but implementing a deep neural network for translation brought the service nearly to the level of human translators. The trranslation ... correct word to use depend on the contact on the other words in the sentence and even in the paraghraph. Much of the information contain a language is in the sequence of the words.

So far we have been working with ... called feed forward networks. The inputs feed into the networks and paprigates to forward throw the hidden layers to the output layer. In feed fowrward network there are no sence of order in the inputs.

We have just simple idea. Let's build order into our networks.
