Hi everyone, wellcome back. this week we-are covering autoencoders. This is _____ network arcitecures to perfoem data compression. Where the compression and decompression function learn itself. none hand enginere by humans.

The general idea with autoenoders is to pass your input data throw encoder to make a compress representaion of the input. The you pass the representation throw a decoder to get back reconstructed data.

The encoder and decoder are both build with neural networks. The whole network is trained by minimizing the difference between input and output, like normal. In this way the middle layer will be compress represention of input data. ____ you can reconstruct the ____ data. There will be some lost of information ofcourse, because you have fewer unit ___.

In practice, autoencoders are worse act compression than traditional method
